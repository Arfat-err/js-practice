// Modules in JavaScript allow you to split your code into reusable, maintainable files and import/export parts as needed. This keeps your code organized and avoids global scope pollution.

// A module is just a JavaScript file that exports some code (like functions, variables, or classes), and can be imported into another file.

export default function myName (fName , lName){
    console.log("The full name is : ", fName, " " ,lName)
}
 export  const age = 20;
